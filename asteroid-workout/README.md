This is a workout app designed to utilize the heart rate sensor on the watch. You can start the workout time, access settings, and view a summary of your workout once finished. Based off of the Orange Theory zones, this workout app changes the background color based on your heart rate. Try to stay in more intense zones. The app comes with settings to adjust your max heart rate (age and weight) and comes with four workout types.
